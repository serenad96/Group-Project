# The Project Proposal
## Theme:
The theme of the project will be a Cafe Simulator where the user can decide what drink they would like.

## Features
There will be an abstract main class called Drink and two derived classes called Tea and Coffee.</br>
The derived classes will have different properties such as type, roast, decaf, etc. </br>
There will be a GUI using Labels and Buttons to select your options.

## UML Diagram
In the included files

## GUI Sketch
Starts with a main screen that asks if you want coffee or tea. From there you can decide what type you would like.

## Final Project Submission
Theme:

The theme of the project will be a Cafe Simulator where the user can choose how they would like their coffee. The total price of their drink will be displayed once they have chosen all their selections. 

Feature List:

The program shows the menu of what the user can add to their coffee. The user will first select the size of their coffee, then select either iced or hot and lastly choose the type of dairy they would like. After the user selects all their choices the total price of the coffee is calculated and displayed.

Issues and future work:

The price calculation is not working as of now, so when a choice is selected the total is not displayed. We used the "on action" feature in SceneBuilder to assign each button to a method. However, it returns a "NullPointerException" error once the buttons are clicked. We are not sure how to fix it. We would like for the total price of the coffee to be displayed. To improve our program we would like to add more options to the menu for the user to choose.

Project Requirements:

We were not able to fufill every project requirement with the way we handled this program. There is no polymorphic call, abstract class or arrays. 

The classes are: PrimaryControl

HAS-A relationship:

IS-A relationship:

JAVAFX gui includes grid pane and anchor pane. We also used textfield, labels and radio buttons.
